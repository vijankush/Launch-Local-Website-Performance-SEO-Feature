If you are reading this as someone running or involved in a small business, we just want to say that we are here to help.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large">Launch Local’s goal is to empower small businesses and nonprofits across the nation to build sustainable digital platforms. And we can proudly say with our most recent project, we’ve done exactly that.</p><p class="sqsrte-large">Our client, <a href="https://timberlandespresso.com/"><span>Timberland Espresso</span></a>, is a small coffee shop located right off of I-5 on the way to Mount St. Helens in WA. Since their founding in 2013, Timberland Espresso has enjoyed serving the community of Castle Rock. The local coffee shop serves all types of caffeine needs from a warm espresso and specialty iced coffee drinks, to a variety of teas.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">The Timberland Espresso team is dedicated to making the coffee experience as convenient as possible and knew that their service was too important to their customers to become another victim of the small businesses closure pattern. So, they reached out to us - Launch Local - for help.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large"><br>When the Timberland Espresso team initially approached us, they needed help improving their digital presence. They showed great potential in attracting new customers if they could develop better customer management systems and a stronger digital impact.</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large">Excited to dive straight into work, our team was led by LL project manager, Ankush Vij, who established our overarching goal to improve Timberland Espresso’s digital presence and branding in order to attract new customers. We did so by tackling 4 areas:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Implementing a modern redesign of the website and logo</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Tracking outreach methods</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Revamping their social media presence</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Detailed market research</p></li></ul><h3>Redesigning the website and logo</h3><p class="sqsrte-large">In recreating the logo, we tackled the task by first noting what we wanted to keep and get rid of. The logo was outdated and we wanted to make it more modernized and smaller but really liked the trees, as they reflected the outdoorsy scene of Washington. We decided to modernize it whilst also keeping the same colors and concept of the original logo.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large">The original website was hard-coded from scratch with simple displays and navigation bars. The website was not scalable across devices and was made specifically for desktop viewing only. We knew the website needed a modern and simplistic revamp to ensure a more attractive and user-friendly experience. We also decided to add links to socials and reviews in order to attract more potential clients and develop successful relationships.</p>

The analytics for the new website showed there were almost twice as many page views as page sessions, which means that the average visitor was exploring ~2 pages per visit on the site. This is a good indicator of site usability and navigation.</p><h3>Revamping their social media presence</h3><p class="sqsrte-large">LL Analyst, Isha Patel, strengthened relationships with clients by responding to positive and negative reviews on TE’s behalf and brainstorming effective strategies to enhance the client experience. The team also created an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/timberlandespresso/"><span>Instagram</span></a> page for TE, as they had previously only had a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/timberlandespresso/"><span>Facebook</span></a> page.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">Working on increasing outreach, Isha focused on gaining followers for the accounts. I myself, an LL analyst, created all the graphics as well as separate story highlight reels with information pertaining to the menu, including everything from drinks and food to location, reviews and specials.</p><p class="sqsrte-large"><br>Here are a few screenshots of the graphics we created for Timberland Espresso’s social media presence:</p>

Website builders are made for beginners like you. You don’t have to be a pro with computers or have any coding skills. Making a website can be so easy, you could finish within one week or even one day (though not recommended). Of course, you still need to learn how to structure and choose your content in order to accurately and effectively communicate the ethos of your business and the product or service that you are providing. </p><p class="sqsrte-large">This post will focus on the first step, choosing your platform, but it’ll be helpful to have a general idea of what content and site structure you’re considering to choose the right platform for you.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">First, let us <strong>introduce you to four website builders</strong> and what they are. Then we will talk about what you should look for when you are choosing an editor, so you can get started.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h1>1.

<p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>WIX is easily considered the best because of its ease of use and customization capabilities.</strong> It has two types of builders: </p><p class="sqsrte-large"><em>WIX Editor</em> and <em>WIX ADI</em> (Artificial Design Intelligence). </p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong><em>WIX Editor</em> is your classic drag and drop editor where you choose from 800+ templates.</strong> If you’d rather not edit with templates and save time, <strong><em>WIX ADI </em>can create and design a website for you based on your answers to a few simple questions.</strong> In that case, you would not have full control in customizing your website, but you have the option to switch back to WIX Editor. </p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>WIX is also the only site on this list that you can edit without section constraint/locked boxes.</strong> <em>For example, you can move your logo image not only a few millimeters to the right, but to anywhere on your screen.</em>&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">The WIX app market includes 300+ services and features to add onto your website. This is a great editor if you plan on keeping your site small (within 30 pages). It only has one sub-level navigation (two layers deep), so the site is not suitable for complex structured pages.</p>

Team management allows you to assign other people to edit your website.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong><em>What really makes Weebly different is giving you the option to have membership areas.</em></strong> This means that you can dedicate parts of your website only to particular members or customers. It can also support large websites (more than 40 pages).&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong><em>The learning curve is harder than WIX but easier than Squarespace.</em></strong> The drag-and-drop editor is not as flexible as WIX, so if you prefer total freedom in customization, Weebly would be frustrating to use.

<p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>If your main goal is to create an e-commerce website, Shopify was built for you. </strong>It will help you in setting up your store and manage your large inventory. The app store consists of 1,200+ sales tools, and the site is scalable, meaning it can support your small or large business. It includes a variety of payments options, customer logins, product management, and more. It also comes with a basic built-in blog, but it's missing many features you would find on WIX and feels limited.</p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>You will have less creative freedom in creating your site, but it is easy to use and gives you what you need for your online business.</strong> The platform charges you extra transaction fees unless you use Shopify Payments - a convenient in-house payment method you use on Shopify - with no fees! Unfortunately, it is not available everywhere. The site can also become pricey with paid apps, premium themes, and transaction fees.</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large">SEO may be the most important technique for a business in reaching new customers. With user-experience being such a significant customer retention factor, improving your SEO may be a great way to give your small business a competitive advantage over your competitors.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">Here are a few SEO strategies that can ensure your small business will prosper this coming year!&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>1. Increase the speed of your website&nbsp;</strong></h3><p class="sqsrte-large">In July 2018, Google released a statement that <strong>mobile page speed is the number one factor used to determine web page rankings</strong>. With the increasing use of technology, page speed is more important than ever. Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/"><em>PageSpeed Insights</em></a> tool is a simple way to test out the current speed of your webpages.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">One simple way you can improve your website speed is by decreasing the size of the images on your website:&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">• By compressing the size of images, the browser will take less time to appear without compromising the quality of the image.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>2. Create a “Google+ Local” &amp; “Google Places” Page</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>The strongest way for any business to grow is through the support of its community</strong>. According to Zero Zen Data, 70% of customers trust reviews from unknown users on platforms such as Google Places, Local, Yahoo, and Yelp. The impact that external reviews have upon a business’s ability to grow is immense and one positive review could bring an influx of loyal customers to your brand. Creating a Google+ Local or Places page is particularly beneficial for improving SEO, because it will also help you to make sure the correct business information is being shared with the web/your community.&nbsp;Learn more about Google+ Local and Google Places, <a href="https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2013/09/06/google-places-for-business-vs-google-local/">here</a>. </p>

The query loses relevance as an applicable search appears.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large"><em>Example: (A user searches) Best Socks under $25&nbsp;</em></p><p class="sqsrte-large"><span>Keyword:</span> A phrase that a user types that businesses try to rank high for, in order to appear in the top ten displayed results.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large"><em>Example: (A user searches) Best socks&nbsp;</em></p>

<p class="sqsrte-large">The <em>specificity </em>of long-term search queries is what Google’s SEO analytics determine as a <em>ranking factor</em>.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">Still not convinced?&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Long-tail queries are stated to send 70% more traffic to websites and blogs</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">If you are a small business owner without a big budget, this serves as a great opportunity!&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>4. Increase the use of internal links</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Increasing the number of internal links on your site can have a direct effect on Google's ranking</strong>. Internal links are defined as links that connect one page on a domain to another page on the same domain — in other words, including links on your site pages that link to other pages on your site.</p><p class="sqsrte-large">So, what pages should have more internal links?&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">Using google analytics, find the pages on your site that are in the 2nd-4th ranking. These pages are powerful because they already drive a significant amount of traffic. Therefore, including more internal links on these pages may increase your chances of improving your site’s PageRank (Google’s way of measuring the importance of website pages).&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>5. Fix broken links and pages that are not working</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Broken links can be one reason why website traffic tapers off</strong>. Broken backlinks can occur when a linking site has bugs, or when a page that has backlinks is deleted or moved.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large">﻿<strong>Eat nutritiously.</strong> This doesn’t mean diet - in fact, it means quite the opposite. It means making sure that you are eating foods that brighten you. What wakes you up? What slows you down? There’s a lot of research into healthy v unhealthy food on the web but we’re not here for that. You can do the research and you can listen to your body, then work towards consuming foods that make you feel good. Do this and your brain will work sharper and you’ll be less vulnerable to emotional outbursts and getting stuck in your lows. </p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong><em>Need some help?</em>&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Try these fresh + affordable meal kits delivered to you portioned with recipes for home-cooking - (less than $8 per meal)</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><a href="https://www.hellofresh.com/"><span>HelloFresh</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><a href="https://www.blueapron.com/"><span>Blue Apron</span></a>&nbsp;</p></li></ul>

<p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Exercise daily.</strong> No that doesn’t mean you need to run that big run every day or even go to the gym every day. It just means that every day, you make time to move your body to get your blood flowing and to get some fresh air. This could look like going for a medium-paced walk around your neighborhood for 30 minutes. Then a few days later, maybe go for an hour or do two walks. Exercise gets your blood flowing which means more oxygen moves around your body and oxygen wakes you up and energizes you, so this is great to keep in mind if you’re feeling slow one day. Sometimes you need a nap, sometimes you need to walk. </p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong><em>Need some help?</em></strong></p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Try a fitness app or online workout -&nbsp;</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><a href="https://obefitness.com/how-it-works"><span>Obe</span></a> - fitness app with live + on-demand home workout videos</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><a href="https://dailyburn.com/landing#!hiit"><span>Daily Burn</span></a> - fitness app, high intensity personalized home workouts + videos</p></li></ul>

<p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Nourish your mind.</strong> Maybe you love your job, maybe you do it for the money. Either way, it’s a good idea to feed a passion or enjoyment that’s separate from your business. Something you do just for pleasure that gets your brain excited and doesn’t make you think about work. Maybe you enjoy reading good fiction or maybe you’re interested in scientific articles or playing an instrument or painting or researching a particular topic. Whatever it is, make time for it each day even if it’s just 15 fully dedicated minutes.

<p class="sqsrte-large">What platforms and how many platforms you use to communicate with your team and keep track of projects, will depend on how big your team is, how many (if any) sub-teams you have and of course, the nature of the work you are doing.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">In any business, however, there is a common thread of what is being communicated that generally looks like -</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Workflow (day-to-day operational communications)</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Ideas (sharing solutions + feedback)</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Milestones + Updates (sharing goals met/upcoming + news)</p></li></ol><h3><em>Workflow </em></h3><p class="sqsrte-large">Communicating about every-day operations can look like anything from asking where that file is that you’re looking for, to getting clarification on a task. This is arguably the most important form of communication to ensure runs smoothly, because the functioning of the business relies on it and so does your employees’ satisfaction.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large">It is very important that the people in your business feel like they can communicate with you and their coworkers with ease. If day-to-day communication on the little stuff is too difficult, people may choose to communicate less, ask less questions, get less clarification and ultimately may result in poorly run operations.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">In order to streamline communication across your team, consider using a professional mobile+desktop application like one of the following…</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><a href="https://telegram.org/"><span>Telegram</span></a> - good for smaller teams (&lt; 8 people), few or no sub-teams</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><a href="https://slack.com/downloads/mac"><span>Slack</span></a> - good for larger teams, multiple sub-teams, sharing files</p></li></ul><p class="sqsrte-large">If you’re accustomed to discussing work over text or email and are wondering why go through the hassle of shifting over to a new application - the simple answer is great organization. Particularly for larger teams (8 or more people), applications like Slack allow you to easily keep track of all work-related messages in one place, that are searchable and can easily be opened from your desktop computer or mobile phone. It is a clean workspace dedicated solely to your enterprise, which can also be great for separating your work life from everything else in your life.&nbsp;</p><h3><em>Ideas </em></h3><p class="sqsrte-large">Having a communication channel dedicated to sharing ideas and feedback, is very important to make sure everyone is on the same page about projects and that work isn’t lost on ideas that took form unapproved or unsupervised.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large">This mode of communication is the most dependent on what your business is - for example if your projects are very visual (e.g. interior design), then you’ll want a collaborative space that accounts for that.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">Here is a starter list to consider -&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><a href="https://www.notion.so/"><span>Notion</span></a> - a notebook-type workspace, great for documenting + collaborating on ideas; or use for personal planning and tracking one’s own progress on tasks</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><a href="https://www.google.com/drive/using-drive/"><span>Google Drive</span></a> - collaborating + commenting on documents, presentations + excel sheets, organized into folders and options for different permissions (viewer v editor)</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><a href="https://miro.com/"><span>Miro</span></a> - collaborative whiteboards + idea mapping with synchronized video calls (to mimic real-life team meetings / brainstorms)</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><a href="https://about.pinterest.com/en"><span>Pinterest</span></a> - use private visual boards to share collections of images (e.g. mood boards)&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p class="sqsrte-large"><br>Of course there are many other platforms out there, these are just a few very good options so check them out and if none of them quite fit the bill, you can research platforms like these by searching for “online collaboration tools (for remote teams)”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><em>Milestones + Updates </em></h3><p class="sqsrte-large">Communication tools like slack and telegram are great for back-and-forth messaging on the little things, but for keeping view of the big picture, you’ll want to use a project management tool. Such tools will allow you to lay out what projects are currently being worked on, visually lay out timelines + progress and assign tasks to different team members.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large">Choosing how to allocate your resources can be difficult because of course, you want your business to grow, but at the same time you know you need to have the capacity to handle that growth. It is especially important in uncertain times like these to make sure you can support your current business activities and costs before creating additional costs. Sometimes it can be difficult to decide how to make that split. To be clear - this is about deciding where to direct the effort of your workers’ time + skills as well as your cash and any other capital (e.g. technology, machines, real estate etc.).&nbsp;</p><h3><em>Understanding Your Financials </em></h3><p class="sqsrte-large">The first important thing to make sure you’re doing in order to be on the right track to making smart decisions here, is to have all your current costs clearly laid out - particularly highlighting your ongoing and necessary fixed costs (i.e. bills/wages that must be paid every month). One great way to do this is to use financial statements.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">There are 3 big ones here -&nbsp;</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Income statement - (<a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/how-to-prepare-an-income-statement-393583"><span>make one</span></a>)</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Balance sheet - (<a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/how-to-prepare-a-balance-sheet-393581"><span>make one</span></a>)</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Cash flow statement - (<a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/how-to-prepare-a-statement-of-cash-flows-393584"><span>make one</span></a>) or (use <a href="https://www.shopify.ca/capital/calculator"><span>Shopify's online calculator</span></a>)</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p></li></ol>

<p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Creating a good income statement will be useful for having a clear view of how much money you’re receiving and how much you’re spending.</strong> The statement is made up of your revenue, expenses and profit. If you really want to hone in on where you should be allocating your resources, you might consider a creatively adapted income statement that breaks down the ‘revenue’ section into different revenue streams - i.e. how much money came in from online vs in-store sales or how much money came in through different sales reps/clerks or even broken down by product type etc. It’s extra work, but it may make a significant difference to your perspective on your business operations, especially when cross-referenced with your expenses to see what costs are paying off the most in revenue.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Creating a good balance sheet will be useful for keeping track of what you owe and what you are owed. </strong>This statement is made up of your assets and liabilities. This is important because you might find that even if you don’t have a lot of cash to invest in growth, that you’re owed a substantial amount (e.g. from customers) and so can afford to use the cash you have now for growth purposes. Conversely, you might discover that you’ve been spending a lot on growth because you have a lot of cash in the bank, but underestimated your liabilities (i.e. money that you owe or will need to pay soon). Therefore, this statement can be very important for planning how to best allocate your resources. Again, you might consider designing your own here, possibly breaking down your ‘accounts receivable’ into where they are receivable from - e.g. is there one customer or business who always seems to owe you money? Or maybe you have property/equipment that you forgot about or are not taking full advantage of.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Creating a good cash flow statement will be useful for knowing exactly how much hard cash you have available for spending.</strong> This statement is made up of cash from operations and investing, as well as any depreciation/appreciation/amortization of capital that needs to be factored in. This is important so you can easily see how much cash is in the bank and make sure there’s enough to fund your daily business operations before allocating any of that cash to growth projects/investments.

<p class="sqsrte-large">The first thing you’ll want to do, if you haven’t already, is <strong><em>note down any patterns of spending/receiving that you notice in your sheets</em></strong>. Any particularly popular revenue streams or promising investments or money lost repeatedly to a particular area of business with little or no gain, should all be highlighted and thought through. </p><p class="sqsrte-large">That will be the starting point for strategizing allocation of funds. Once you’ve done this, you may want to create a new budget that takes into account what’s worked and what hasn’t and lays out exactly how you plan to allocate your cash moving forward, even if just in the short term (this can always change and most likely will at some point).</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large">You’ll also want to look at your human capital. How are your employees faring? Are there any that stand out particularly positively or negatively? And if it’s negative, why is it negative? Perhaps that person would be better suited for a different function in the business. You want to make sure you are constantly evaluating how satisfied your employees are and how good their work is, because you may find talent in an employee that’s dragging in one area of the business and would be much better suited to another area.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">In all cases, it just comes down to knowing and constantly refreshing the following sequence in your mind -&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">What capital do I have...&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">...What is the primary function of that capital right now...</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">...How is that capital performing in that current function...</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">...Is there another function that would suit that capital better?</p></li></ul><p class="sqsrte-large">…And if there is - weigh out the pros and cons and see if that shift might make sense for you.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">For example, it may be that you have 5 people performing a job that could be done by one employee with the right skills and mental agility. You might then consider hiring that employee if you have the capacity and moving those 5 other workers to a different section of the business where they may be even more well-suited or where you need more manpower.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">Sometimes, reallocation of resources might even mean changing your business model, expanding your target market or even pivoting your business as a whole. This might be particularly applicable <strong><em>if you’ve had to temporarily or permanently close your business and have skilled workers, equipment or real estate that you’re not sure what to do with</em></strong>.&nbsp;</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class="sqsrte-large"></p><p class="sqsrte-large">Let’s take a look at the possibilities here, because they’re vast!</p><h1>Pivoting + Adapting Your Business Model </h1><p class="sqsrte-large">Have you ever heard the story of how the giraffe got its long neck? Competition for food on the ground and in shrubs had grown so much, many animals began to starve. After a while, an intelligent few began stretching to reach berries from taller shrubs, then further to apples on short trees and over time, these few stretched their necks so persistently that they developed the longest necks in the animal kingdom: Giraffe.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large">Is this story true? Who knows, but it demonstrates a good point. You can start off as one thing and in hostile conditions or an environment that’s changed, you can choose to become something else, strategically. Note that the giraffe didn’t go looking for ways to become a bird to reach the trees - that would have been a miserable journey. Rather, it took what it had and stretched it into what it needed. Let’s think about how we can translate that strategy into a strategy for your business.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">If you can clearly see that your problem is related to serving too narrow of a market or that the market you once served is no longer interested in what you’re offering or is no longer able to allocate their resources to your product/service, then you might want to consider pivoting your business or changing your business model.&nbsp;</p><h3><em>Pivoting </em></h3><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Pivoting your business might look like changing the product or service you offer.</strong> But again, we do this strategically; that’s why we call it a pivot and not a full turnover.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large">Consider hairdressers during the height of the pandemic, in a full lockdown.

<p class="sqsrte-large">Consider a local restaurant, who in the height of the pandemic and full lockdown has had to shut its doors. Traditionally, its tables were filled by local families who sat down, ate, paid and went home. Now, these families are eating at home and they’re choosing to cook instead of order in, because cooking is a fun activity to engage the kids in and they have the time. The business still has customers who order takeout or delivery, but it’s not making enough to pay the bills.</p><p class="sqsrte-large">The owner needs to do something - one option is to adapt the business model.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Here is a demonstration of how this might be done:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Whilst the owner may have traditionally allocated resources to accommodating the ‘families’ market, perhaps purchasing crayons and coloring pages for their young customers, he/she may now <em>decide to focus on a new market and payment structure</em>.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><em>The owner sees an opportunity to serve business professionals</em> who are working from home and don’t always have time to engage in home-cooking.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><em>The owner also realizes that these individuals may not be willing to pay </em>for restaurant food as often as the business needs. As a restaurant, the business has traditionally functioned within a D2C business model (i.e. business selling directly to consumers). However, the owner now considers reaching out to other local businesses or employers of large numbers of local residents, to offer business home catering for their employees.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><em>The owner pitches it as a way to keep employees motivated</em> and loyal to their company during the turbulent times of lockdown and offers promotional prices for serving large groups and introduces a subscription service for meals.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><em>The owner also continues to keep its family customer base happy</em> by including what they have left of crayons and coloring books in every first or fifth order by their family regulars.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p class="sqsrte-large">Simply adjusting the business model and turning the focus, whilst still catering to their customer base will not only improve the restaurant’s chances of staying afloat, but will also increase their customer base for if they open their doors again and the owner may even decide to continue with a corporate arm for their business.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">Change of this nature - whether pivoting or adapting your business model - can seem daunting, but with the right strategy and clear thinking, they can be great options for you. You might even consider asking your current customer base what they’d think of the change if you are worried about losing customer loyalty and they may even have some great recommendations for you. After all, they are the people you are trying to sell to.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large"><br>If you do pivot or change your business model, just make sure to communicate this to your customers and your community. Tell them what’s new, for how long and your reasoning. And if things change - if your store is reopening, for example, make sure to let them know!</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large">Crowdfunding platforms are websites that connect people/businesses (like you) with regular people who may be interested in funding your project with as little as a few dollars. This method of fundraising makes use of the easy accessibility of vast networks of people through social media and the built-in audience of crowdfunding websites.</p><h3><strong><em>Why might crowdfunding be a good idea for you? </em></strong></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">You’re looking for quick funding for a specific project or purpose with clear knowledge of how you’ll be spending the money&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">You have a strong network to share your campaign with&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">You have a great idea with a clear market and interest in your project/cause</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">You are able to offer desirable rewards that aren’t too costly to your business</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">You’ve exhausted all other options and are willing to put in the time to tell a great story to get the resources you need</p></li></ul><p class="sqsrte-large">This is a great way to raise money relatively quickly and without too much red-tape, however, <strong>it won’t work if you don’t advertise your campaign well</strong>. This includes developing a strong campaign that speaks to your audience as well as the marketing of the campaign once it’s done, through your social media, blog, email marketing and any other avenues you can think of.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large">The <strong>first point</strong> of consideration (what will you offer in return for funding) will inform what type of crowdfunding platform you choose to go with. There are 4 key types:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Donation-based - </strong>people give a campaign money for nothing in return / purely to support your business/project</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Rewards-based - </strong>donors receive something in return for their donations. The rewards vary by the size of the donation, which incentivizes higher contributions, e.g. a product sample or gift</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Debt-based - </strong>peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, whereby instead of getting a bank loan, you get a loan from crowdfunding and then repay it by a certain deadline.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Equity-based -</strong> contributors receive equity in your business in exchange for cash.</p></li></ol><p class="sqsrte-large">The most common type of crowdfunding is donation and/or rewards based. Some platforms, like Kickstarter, may even give you the option to offer rewards or not and your decision may depend on how easy it will be for you to do so and whether the benefit will justify the cost of the reward.&nbsp;<br></p><p class="sqsrte-large">The <strong>second point</strong> of consideration (what is the capital for) will inform whether you choose a crowdfunding platform with a <em>focus on innovation or on supporting causes</em>. This is important because you want to choose the platform with the right audience for you, who will be excited about your idea. This will also inform your campaign strategy - i.e. how you tell your story and convince people to give you money. Successful campaigns explain exactly how the fundraiser plans to use the funds and why - so <strong>before you start, make sure you know exactly what you are fundraising for</strong>. Be clear and have good reasoning so that your audience believes in you.</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large"><strong><em>If you are fundraising to grow your business in some way</em></strong>, for example through developing a new product or investing in a new technology or embarking on an innovative project, your campaign should be focused on what is so exciting about this project and how your potential funders or customers will benefit from this investment. In this case, you might want to consider platforms that work on a <strong>rewards or equity based scheme</strong>, if you think the audience you are targeting would be interested in using that particular product (e.g. a reward could be a future discount) or if you believe your investment would increase the value of your business significantly enough for individuals to want to buy into your business (pointing to an equity-based platform).&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">For this type of campaign, the following platforms are a great place to start:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/learn?ref=nav"><span>Kickstarter</span></a> - big-name platform, rewards + donor based&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><a href="https://entrepreneur.indiegogo.com/how-it-works/campaign/"><span>Indiegogo</span></a> - creative works, innovation, community projects, rewards +donor</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><a href="https://www.equitynet.com/raise-capital.aspx"><span>EquityNet</span></a> - accredited investors matched with screened businesses, equity</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Other equity-based platforms <a href="https://www.merchantmaverick.com/best-equity-crowdfunding-sites/"><span>here</span></a></p></li></ul><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="sqsrte-large">Of course, these are only a few suggestions, but are well-vetted and popular platforms, so they are a great place to start. If you’d like more details/comparisons of platforms you can check out this <a href="https://www.crowdfunding.com/"><span>quick comparison matrix</span></a> or this <a href="https://thebalancesmb.com/best-crowdfunding-sites-4580494#best-for-creators-patreon"><span>analysis of best options</span></a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">When conducting research of your own into crowdfunding platforms, here are some additional things to look out for and compare:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Is it all-or-nothing?</strong> - some platforms only allow you to access the capital raised if you hit your goal and if you don’t, all funds are returned to their respective donors.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>What are the fees involved?</strong> - typically you may be charged a fee for processing payments, which may range from 3%–5% per transaction.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>What is the application process?</strong> - some platforms require your campaign to be screened before posting which may take some time.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Who is their main built-in audience?</strong> - make sure the kind of people your platform attracts are those interested in projects like yours. You can check this by seeing what projects have been most successful on the platform.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Are they popular, are their projects doing well?</strong> - check their track record + number of users and user reviews (on both fundraiser and donor sides - you want to know if potential donors trust this platform)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Special features that set it apart</strong> - e.g. a platform may offer special guidance for marketing your campaign</p></li></ul><p class="sqsrte-large">So, you know what you’re fundraising for, you know your needs and your capabilities to reward funders and you’ve done your research into different platforms. As always - try not to get too bogged down comparing all the different platforms - know what you need, what you can give and then make an informed decision.&nbsp;</p><h1>Applying for a Grant</h1><p class="sqsrte-large">If crowdfunding isn’t for you, or if you think you could use an additional hand or maybe you just want to hedge your bets and do both - you might consider applying for a grant. A grant is a non-repayable fund that’s essentially gifted from an institution, such as a government or corporation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large">Although this sounds very appealing - it is not just free money. The application process is often lengthy and rigorous, requiring a lot of time and skill. Furthermore, the intent of most government grants is to fund projects that will benefit specific parts of the population or the community as a whole - so you’ll want to make sure you fit those requirements. There are currently specific programs and grants for covid-19 relief, but those fluctuate so pay attention to dates and deadlines. There are, however, grants and relief programs offered by private companies that may have less rigorous application processes, which we will introduce you to below.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Let’s figure out if applying for a grant is a good idea <em>for you</em></strong> and walk through what you’ll need in order to apply.&nbsp;</p><h3><em>Why apply for a grant?</em></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Less risky than taking out a loan because it doesn’t need to be repaid</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Small business grants are plentiful + easy to find online&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">You have the time and resources to create a great application OR&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">You’ve exhausted all other options and have decided this is the best place to allocate your available time + resources&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h3><em>What you need to be prepared for:</em></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Time consuming application process</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Requires a lot of research, planning + organizing&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Varying application-review times</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Tough competition from other small business applications</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Strict eligibility requirements</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Strict terms of agreement&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p class="sqsrte-large">Again, these points will generally apply to government grants and are not necessarily characteristic of grants you might apply to from privately-owned companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large">If you are looking for money to fund the manpower of your business, you might want to consider creating an internship program that will allow you to take advantage of “free” labor in exchange for great mentorship and the opportunity to learn. </p><p class="sqsrte-large">Right now is a great time to look for interns given the precarious state of the job market and online schooling, leaving a lot of young and intelligent minds just itching to work on meaningful and educational projects. And you never know - you may find an intern who works so well with your business that you’ll end up taking them on full-time. </p><p class="sqsrte-large">Alternatively, you might consider hiring a freelancer to work a one-off project if you need an expert for something but can’t afford/don’t require a full-time hire.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large"><strong><em>If your main reason for moving online is to increase your reach</em></strong> then you might consider selling on a pre-existing marketplace or on the website of another company with the same target market as you but non-competing and ideally complementary products. The former will likely have a much larger built-in user base for you to tap; on the other hand, the right partner might provide a much more targeted user base for your product/service that may transfer better to online engagement/sales. Of course you can always do both if you have the resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large">A partnership like this will only work if both parties are benefitting from the exchange - so make sure you partner with a business who shares your business values and those of your current customers and that you are reaching potential customers outside your current reach. You might even extend your target market through a partnership. </p><p class="sqsrte-large"><em>For example, your business might be face-painting for children’s birthday parties, but perhaps your capabilities could include costume makeup for adults too and advertising your service on an adult costume store’s website leading up to Halloween might help you expand your market reach. “Partnerships” like these don’t have to be permanent or long-term, they can be time-based and promotional in nature too.&nbsp;</em></p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h1>Leveraging social media &amp; data analytics </h1><p class="sqsrte-large">If you’re new to social media, it may take some time to get familiar with the different platforms and best practices for using them.

<p class="sqsrte-large">Right now we are focusing on the latter and the easiest way to get that information is through data analytics. Luckily, many of these social media platforms have analytics built-in that you can access as a business-account user.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">The kind of data you’ll have access to may include: posts with the most likes, button clicks, pageviews per/x time period etc. <strong>By analyzing this data, you will learn what kind of posts do better than other kinds, which will help you refine your marketing strategy.</strong> You will also learn more about who your active engagement is coming from and if that aligns with your target market.&nbsp;</p>

<h1><em>﻿</em>Positive Reviews</h1><p class="sqsrte-large">Customers read your reviews before doing business with you and the more highly-rated reviews there are, the more customers your business will attract. </p><p class="sqsrte-large"><em>But positive reviews are not the ones harming your business so why respond to them? </em></p><p class="sqsrte-large">Well, your customers took time out of their busy day to write a review that would benefit your business, so it is crucial that you show your appreciation. They are guiding other potential customers to your business and showing that you value your current customers will increase the chances of those customers returning and/or telling other people about you. </p><p class="sqsrte-large">Here are some guidelines for responding to a positive review:&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Start by thanking them&nbsp;</strong></h3><p class="sqsrte-large">Let them know you are grateful they had a positive experience and personalize the response by addressing them by name at least once. Do not copy and paste the same response you used with another reviewer; every response should be somewhat unique or else it comes off as careless.&nbsp;</p><h4>Here is an example:</h4>

<p class="sqsrte-large"><em>﻿</em>If you believe the customer has clearly misunderstood the situation, carefully clarify and explain how they can resolve the issue without invalidating the customer’s experience and remain apologetic for the confusion. You can even ask if they have any suggestions for how you can make the customer experience easier/prevent future issues of this nature with other customers.</p><h3><strong>Emphasize that this doesn't usually happen</strong></h3><p class="sqsrte-large">Make sure to remind the reviewer, or whomever may be reading your reviews, that most of the experiences are positive - still, without invalidating or belittling their experience. </p><h4>Here is an example of what you can write, following the part above:&nbsp;</h4>

<h1>Mixed Reviews&nbsp;</h1><p class="sqsrte-large">Most reviews are going to be overwhelmingly positive or negative, but businesses still endure their fair share of mixed reviews. These fall into anything between 2-4 stars, not outstanding but not terrible. Most of these reviews also refer to a mix of pros and cons about the business. </p><p class="sqsrte-large">It's important to acknowledge these because you want to show that you’re all for constructive criticism and always looking for ways to improve. Plus, you are not just speaking to that one reviewer but everyone who reads that review and it will show initiative on your part and your commitment to customer relations. </p><p class="sqsrte-large">Here are some guidelines for responding to a mixed review:&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Thank the customer for the review&nbsp;</strong></h3><p class="sqsrte-large">Even if the review has flaws, it's important to acknowledge the customer intends to help improve your business.&nbsp;</p><h4>Here is an example:</h4>

And right now they are struggling. The coronavirus pandemic has hit businesses hard across the board, and according to a Mckinsey report, those amongst the least financially resilient include <strong>1.7 million small businesses</strong>, leaving 20 million workers vulnerable.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large">	At Launch Local, we have assembled a highly skilled and passionate team to offer free consulting and business services to struggling small businesses across the nation with backgrounds ranging from web/graphic design to professional consulting and financial services.&nbsp;</p><p class="sqsrte-large">Our client, <a href="https://classiccarolinaunc.com/">Classic Carolina</a>, is a family-owned UNC apparel store that sells everything from t-shirts to dog leashes and is best known for their humorous designs and their customer relationships. However, despite the local popularity of this establishment, Classic Carolina did not have the digital tools or online presence that became so important when the pandemic hit. </p><p class="sqsrte-large">When we first approached shop owners Dhruva and Kris Chellani, they explained, <em>“We are a small mom-and-pop shop on Franklin Street. We have a great location and a lot of great products, but we don’t have brand recognition, we have a terrible market presence, and we have an even worse online presence.”</em></p>

<p class="sqsrte-large"><strong><em>“I bought it because I saw it on TikTok!” </em></strong></p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong><em>“Their Instagram feed was just so aesthetically pleasing!” </em></strong></p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong><em>“The video had so many shares on Facebook so I had to check it out!”</em></strong></p><p class="sqsrte-large">If you have heard or said these phrases yourself, that means the business/user has successfully marketed their product! Social media undeniably plays an influential role in our lives. With technology becoming more and more advanced with every passing day, we have become dependent on our devices to keep us in touch with the world. What started out as a mode of keeping in touch with our friends and family, has joined forces with the business world and is used for a whole array of marketing strategies. </p><p class="sqsrte-large">In this post, we’ll be looking at <strong>marketing tips for three specific apps: TikTok, Instagram &amp; Facebook.</strong></p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class="sqsrte-large"></p><h3><strong>TikTok</strong></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Released in September of 2016, TikTok is a social media platform that lets users create a variety of short videos with a wide variety of genres, ranging from comedy and dance, to education and promotions.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">One of the reasons why TikTok has become one of the biggest media platforms is due to the constant entertainment of these short videos. The videos are curated towards the users’ likes retention rate, but this doesn’t mean the user can always know what to expect. Because of the easy-to-use features, micro-entertainment, and its predecessors — Musically &amp; Vine — TikTok is now one of the most popular social platforms among Generation Z.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Tick-Tock, It’s Time to Get Creative!</strong></h4><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Create your own channel &amp; upload videos advertising your product.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Making a TikTok is the first step in providing your customers with insight into your business and showing them what you’re all about. People love to watch transformational videos, so some TikTok ideas could be: “How I Package Orders!” or “Watch Me Create [insert product]!”</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">If you can find a way to encourage your customers to share videos of themselves using or interacting with your products in some way, you’re likely to get a more successful response.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Keep in touch with what is trending &amp; try to tie that into your TikToks.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Although this is not a necessity, using trends that are popular will increase engagement. This can be something as simple as using the same song that is trending in your videos (for instance, Olivia Rodrigo’s <em>Drivers License</em>).</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Hashtags. Hashtags. Hashtags. Did I mention hashtags?</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Hashtags help categorize the video to cater to different audiences. So if your business was a clothing store centered in San Francisco, you should use “#clothing #SanFrancisco #style #fyp” and so forth. This is also not required for your video to gain attention but it definitely helps more than not putting anything!</p></li></ul></li></ol><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class="sqsrte-large"></p><h3><strong>Instagram</strong></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Happy Belated 10th Birthday to Instagram! Launched in October 2010, Instagram has now accumulated over one billion users. This app is used to stay updated with the lives of our friends, families, and favorite celebrities. With a heavy emphasis on photo and video sharing, Instagram has evolved throughout the years and has become a huge brand marketing platform. New updates have been added such as stories, highlight reels, and a shopping tab which all help users to be exposed to different accounts and businesses.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Often referred to as the “simplified version of Facebook”, Instagram is a social network that lets you see how many followers you have, how many you are following, how many likes you have on each photo, and so forth. It is an app that is big on numbers and creating the perfect image for our followers to see.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Pics or It Didn’t Happen</strong></h4><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Personal to Business Account</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Instagram has a feature that lets you change the type of account you have. The perks of turning your account into a business account, are that you can access the data analytics of your posts, separate your messaging inboxes and display your contact information on your profile.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Aesthetic Content</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Since Instagram focuses on photos and videos, it’s important to generate visually compelling content that entails what your brand is and shows your products. To keep your audience engaged, try to include a variety of content, whether that be quotes or instructional posts.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Use Story Highlights</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Story Highlights are placed at the bottom of your Instagram bio and are immediately seen when a user visits your profile. Knowing this, it’s important to create different categories that you would want potential consumers to visit to learn more information quicker. For example, if you’re a photography company, different highlight categories could be “Prices,” “Published Work,” “Behind the Scenes,” and so on.</p></li></ul></li></ol><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h3><strong>Facebook</strong></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">What started as a website intended for Harvard students to communicate has become the most popular social media platform worldwide today. Originally launched as “TheFacebook” in 2004, the platform currently sits at more than 2.7 billion monthly active users. This social networking site makes it easy for users to connect and share with friends and family online.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Over the years, the platform has integrated businesses by including ads, promotions, and entertainment. It has become easy to sell your product and enhance your own business on Facebook as it is easier to use than other platforms and has been around for longer. Although the younger generations would undoubtedly say that Facebook is used for older generations, it still plays an influential role in the social networking world.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>*Gently Pokes You*</strong></h4><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Create a Facebook Business Page</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Similar to Instagram’s business features, Facebook has an option to create your own business page that will allow you to add a “call-to-action” button, create your own username, see who views your page, and so on.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Keep Them Engaged</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Facebook is about building relationships so don’t focus too much on self-promotion when you should be building value for your followers. For example, creating instructional videos, polling your followers, answering questions and taking into account the concerns of your followers, will help you build a more stable relationship with your followers and extend your reach.</p></li></ul></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Link Your Website</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">With so many Internet users that are only increasing, it’s easy to run into website traffic. By creating your own website and including an option to stay connected through Facebook, users can easily become customers and switch back and forth between your Facebook Page and your website for more info.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p></li></ul></li></ol><p class="sqsrte-large">These are just a few tips for each of these social platforms and there are an abundance of strategies out there that will surely help you promote your business. Finding the strategies that are perfect for you and your business is essential in establishing your brand. Remember, sell the problem you solved and not the product!</p><p class=""><br></p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/png" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5fd6d3753c1f627580a14436/1610594858364-NFR0X75GFQE1CLT1YJPZ/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kGaBSG_GrSGuYbxg0Fmwfm17gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UV8hQ1sHl94AUXCoTX2uWSqwqjJZ-JybtKM2u03GsfhAZDqXZYzu2fuaodM4POSZ4w/marketing+tips+2.PNG?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="840"><media:title type="plain">Tips for Top Social Media Platforms</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Improve Your Social Media Presence</title><dc:creator>Hiral Patel</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 04 Sep 2020 17:15:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.launchlocal.org/blog/social-media-presence</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5fd6d3753c1f627580a14436:5fedae19fc8ee327ddc3bd64:5fedae19fc8ee327ddc3bd65</guid><description><![CDATA[By: Hiral Patel

Social media makes it easier for friends and family to support your business while also displaying your products to new customers. People are constantly on social media throughout the day, so it’s important that businesses invest their time in creating a strong social media presence. </p><p class="sqsrte-large">As you establish your social media presence, we have curated a list of ideas to keep in mind.</p><h3><strong>1. Have a Strategy</strong></h3><p class="">Decide on the following before you start to revamp your social media…</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Who your target audience is going to be</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Which platforms you plan to use</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">What kind of content you want to post: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansutter/2017/07/14/21-ideas-for-social-media-content-for-your-small-business/?sh=7f6faeda3011">content ideas source: Forbes</a></p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">How often you will post</p></li></ul><h3><strong>2. Use Multiple Platforms</strong></h3><p class="">Using multiple platforms will broaden your reach and help you get noticed…</p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Instagram - </strong>Target audience includes people who are below 50 years old</p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Facebook - </strong>Great for all audiences</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><a href="https://www.dummies.com/business/marketing/social-media-marketing/how-to-claim-a-facebook-places-page-for-your-business/">How to gain access</a></p></li></ul><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>TikTok - </strong>Target audience includes people who are below 30 years old</p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>LinkedIn - </strong>Great for those whose target audience is other businesses or professionals</p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Twitter - </strong>Great way to interact with local community members and potential customers</p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Pinterest - </strong>Great for restaurants, fashion, art, travel, and event-planning oriented businesses</p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>YouTube - </strong>Great for products that require a guide: tutorials on how to use your product or videos on how the product is produced</p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Yelp -</strong> Applicable for any business that has a physical storefront</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><a href="https://www.yelp-support.com/article/How-do-I-claim-a-business-page?l=en_US">How to gain access</a></p></li></ul><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Google My Business</strong> <strong>- </strong>Applicable for any business that has a physical storefront</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/4566671?hl=en">How to gain access</a></p></li></ul><h3><strong>3. Add Social Icons to Emails &amp; Your Website</strong></h3><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong><em>Social media icons on your website and email help increase traffic to your pages</em></strong>, which will help things like search engine optimization (SEO). Icons are small so they don’t distract the customer and also make it easier for customers to learn more about your products. </p><h3><strong>4. Create Content with Your Audience in Mind</strong></h3><p class="sqsrte-large">When you are creating your content, you can use the “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansutter/2017/07/14/21-ideas-for-social-media-content-for-your-small-business/?sh=7f6faeda3011">what kind of content to post</a>” resource. </p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong><em>You should create posts with your audience in mind in order to keep them interested.</em></strong> Customers follow your page because they want to stay informed about new products or sales. If your posts tend to be unengaging or off-topic, customers will begin to unfollow you.</p><h3><strong>5. Maintain Presence&nbsp;</strong></h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Do some research on what the most popular time and day to scroll among your target audience is</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Post to your social media regularly, preferably weekly, whether it be stories or posts</p></li></ul><h3><strong>6. Use Apps to Schedule Posts</strong></h3><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong><em>Use an app that allows you to schedule posts</em></strong> to Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest. One such app is <a href="https://later.com/"><strong><em>Later</em></strong></a>. </p><p class="">The benefits of using these apps include…</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Not having to create social media content in real time - create content in one day for the rest of the week/month/etc.</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Not having to remember or make time for posting to social media every day - the app can do it for you by scheduling posts in advance </p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">Use their analytics tools to see how your posts performed - level of engagement on different posts, best posting times etc. </p></li></ul><h3><strong>7. Engage with Your Audience</strong></h3><p class="sqsrte-large">Engaging with your followers and potential followers is important in <strong><em>showing your customers you care about them and their feedback</em></strong>. It allows you to gain trust and interest in your business. </p><p class="">When you aren’t posting, you should be…</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">sharing posts</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">asking questions</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">addressing complaints</p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">liking posts and comments, etc.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>8. Hashtags</strong></h3><p class="sqsrte-large">Using hashtags is one of the easiest ways to bring traffic to your page. </p><p class="sqsrte-large"><em>Example: If you own a jewelry store in SoHo, Manhattan, you’ll want new customers in that area to stumble upon your page when they search #sohojewelry and #sohoshopping</em> </p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong><em>Make sure you are not using hashtags excessively; the average number of hashtags businesses use is ~11.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p class="sqsrte-large">Hashtags also help engage people with your brand. <strong><em>Create a specific hashtag for your business</em></strong>, so when customers share your product to their own social media they can use the hashtag. This will…</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large">allow people to click on the hashtag and find your posts, as well as other people’s posts. </p></li><li><p class="sqsrte-large">make it easier to interact with customers and re-share. </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="sqsrte-large"><em>Example: If your jewelry store was named Ruby Designs and located in Westlake, Seattle, your business specific hashtag could be #RubyDesignsSeattle or #RubyWestlake</em></p></li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>9. Share Reviews</strong></h3><p class="sqsrte-large">Ask your customers to share their purchases with their friends on social media. Your email confirmation page or physical receipt is a great place to add this. </p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong><em>Share their posts to your pages as well as reviews</em></strong> they may have written on Google Reviews, Yelp, etc. Customers love this because it makes them feel acknowledged. This will also help affirm to potential customers that existing customers are happy with your product/service.</p><h3><strong>10. Customer Service</strong></h3><p class="sqsrte-large">Many customers will comment their issues on your posts or tell you them through direct message. In order to keep customers happy, <strong><em>respond as quickly as possible</em></strong>. This is essential in limiting the spread of negative reviews and providing quality customer support.</p><p class="sqsrte-large">In order to measure what’s working and what’s not, you will have to watch for new followers and engagement. Every business is unique, so there is no perfect formula for every business. </p><p class="sqsrte-large">Don’t be afraid to try new ideas to see what works and what doesn’t!</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class="sqsrte-large"></p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5fd6d3753c1f627580a14436/1609412417106-0E02HYJQENY8V3J3JJJB/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLkXF2pIyv_F2eUT9F60jBl7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0iyqMbMesKd95J-X4EagrgU9L3Sa3U8cogeb0tjXbfawd0urKshkc5MgdBeJmALQKw/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1000"><media:title type="plain">Improve Your Social Media Presence</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Introducing Launch Local</title><dc:creator>Guest User</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 11 Apr 2020 17:05:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.launchlocal.org/blog/introducing-launch-local</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5fd6d3753c1f627580a14436:5fedae19fc8ee327ddc3bd64:5fedae19fc8ee327ddc3bd69</guid><description><![CDATA[Our mission and story]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class=""><strong>Launch Local </strong>was started to empower small businesses by helping them adopt the necessary digital infrastructure to sustain their operations and improve sales.
